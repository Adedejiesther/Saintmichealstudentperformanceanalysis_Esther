Recommendations

1. I encourage students to allocate consistent weekly study hours through structured timetables.
2. Expand the implementation of flip-classroom methods to improve student engagement.
3. Introduce reading challenges or programs to improve reading frequency and comprehension skills.
4. Provide additional support or mentorship to students with lower grades to boost performance.
5. Monitor students' academic progress with a focus on individual strengths and weaknesses.
